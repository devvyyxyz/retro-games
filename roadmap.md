Here's a roadmap for the **Retro Game Emulator Collection**:

### Phase 1: Planning & Setup

1. **Define Game List & Requirements**
   - Finalize the games to include (e.g., Snake, Pong, Tetris).
   - Outline core mechanics for each game, including controls, scoring, and speed settings.

2. **Design & Theme**
   - Sketch a retro design concept: color scheme, fonts, pixel art style.
   - Plan UI elements: game screen, scoreboards, start/pause/reset buttons, and a high-score board.

3. **Technical Setup**
   - Set up project structure with folders for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and assets (e.g., images and fonts).
   - Decide if high scores will be stored locally (e.g., using `localStorage`) or via a backend (e.g., Firebase, a simple Node server).

### Phase 2: Core Development

1. **Game Development**
   - **HTML5 Canvas & JavaScript**: Start building each game on HTML5 Canvas with JavaScript.
   - Implement **basic game logic** for each:
      - Snake: control snake movement, collision detection, and score counting.
      - Pong: paddle control, ball physics, and scoring.
      - Tetris: piece rotation, collision, and line clearing.

2. **User Interface & Controls**
   - Add user-friendly controls (keyboard/mouse/touch support).
   - Implement start, pause, and reset functions for each game.

3. **Retro Styling**
   - Apply CSS for retro themes: pixelated look, old-school fonts, CRT-style effects.
   - Create pixel art for game elements, UI, and backgrounds.

### Phase 3: Score Tracking & High-Score Board

1. **Local High Scores**
   - Use `localStorage` to save scores for each game.
   - Design a high-score board UI, displaying top scores.

2. **Backend Integration (if applicable)**
   - Set up a lightweight backend to store high scores globally if desired.
   - Implement an API to fetch and display global high scores.

### Phase 4: Testing & Optimization

1. **Testing & Debugging**
   - Test each game thoroughly on various devices and screen sizes.
   - Ensure consistent performance, especially for animations and game physics.

2. **Optimize Code & Assets**
   - Minify JavaScript, CSS, and optimize images to improve load times.
   - Check cross-browser compatibility and fix any CSS/JavaScript inconsistencies.

### Phase 5: Deployment & Launch

1. **Deploy to Web Hosting**
   - Use a platform like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel for hosting.
   - Test deployment and ensure all assets and backend (if used) work in production.

2. **Launch & Feedback**
   - Launch the site, gather user feedback, and make improvements as needed.
   
### Optional: Future Enhancements

- Add additional retro games.
- Implement social sharing features for high scores.
- Include retro sound effects and background music for an authentic feel.
